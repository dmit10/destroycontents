A simple script that replaces all files in some svn dump
(except those which start with "link ", they could be symlinks) into
files of the same sizes but with random readable contents (a-z, A-Z,
0-9, _).

The script leaves file names and log messages as is.

The script requires this

If you use Debian, you can simply run

aptitude install libsvn-dump-perl
